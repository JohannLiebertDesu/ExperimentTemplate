/**
 * Generates a break screen trial to insert between experiment blocks.
 *
 * Shows block progress (visual bar + text), a brief encouragement to rest,
 * and a "Continue" button that is disabled for a few seconds to ensure the
 * participant actually pauses before resuming.
 *
 * When running inside JATOS, the break screen also ships all data collected
 * so far to the server (via appendResultData) so that completed blocks are
 * safe even if the browser crashes later. A status property is added to the
 * data marking which blocks have been completed.
 *
 * Usage in your timeline:
 *   import { makeBreakTrial } from "../../functions/global/breakScreen.js";
 *
 *   for (let i = 0; i < totalBlocks; i++) {
 *     timeline.push(blockTrials[i]);
 *     if (i < totalBlocks - 1) {
 *       timeline.push(makeBreakTrial(i + 1, totalBlocks, jsPsych));
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * @param {number} completedBlocks - How many blocks have been completed (1-indexed)
 * @param {number} totalBlocks     - Total number of blocks in the experiment
 * @param {object} jsPsych         - The active jsPsych instance (needed to read data)
 * @param {object} [options]       - Optional overrides
 * @param {number} [options.minBreakMs=5000] - Minimum ms before the button becomes clickable
 * @returns {object} A jsPsych trial configuration (html-button-response)
